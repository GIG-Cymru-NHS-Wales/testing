# Testing

Testing information that developers can use for software engineering:

* Fabrications of testing data, such as synthetic person profiles a.k.a fake users.

* Suggestions for testing practices, such as for unit tests, functional tests, integration tests, end to end tests, reliability tests, and more.

* Sample code for that shows how to implement testing, such protocol code using Postman, browser code using Selenium, and more.

We welcome help with this repository and with testing in general.

* This is a work in progress, akin to a pilot project exploration, to help us understand how to test.

* We are doing this in full public view, to encourage transparency and to encourage collaboration.
