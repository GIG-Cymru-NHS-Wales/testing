# Fabrications

Fabrications are fake data that is intended to be useful for testing software engineering.

All the information in this directory and below is fake, and free, and open source.
 
Each fabrication entry here has a unique identifier called a "ZID". A ZID is a secure random 32-character lowercase hexadecimal string. A ZID can help with software engineering testing of records that may be distributed among multiple software systems, or that may need consistent testing across multiple implementations.

Each fabrication entry here has a variety of fields and values that are intended merely to be starting suggestions. Each software engineering team can freely customize these fields and their values.
