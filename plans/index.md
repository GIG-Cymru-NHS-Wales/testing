# Test Automation Strategic Plan

WORK IN PROGRESS - REQUEST FOR COMMENTS

## Executive Summary

This strategic plan outlines a comprehensive approach to elevate our software engineering test automation capabilities through targeted upskilling, skill coordination, and implementation of specific testing methodologies. The initiative aims to build a robust, scalable test automation framework that reduces manual testing time and cost, that improves software quality, and that speeds up digital delivery.

It also emphasizes that automation will augment, not entirely replace, valuable manual and exploratory testing.

## Current State Assessment Framework

### What are our skill levels?

**Current Manual Testing Processes & Application Landscape:**

- Analyze current manual testing efforts: identify pain points, time-consuming areas, and critical test scenarios.
- Document the application landscape: types of applications (web, mobile, API, legacy), underlying technologies, and current testability.
- Assess team readiness and appetite for change: gauge enthusiasm, anxieties, and preferred learning styles.

**Programming Practices:**

- Survey which languages are in play that we can leverage for frontend testing capabilities 

- Evaluate skill levels for programming methodologies, and key areas of async, UX, DX, CI/CD/CT.

- Scan for enterprise patterns that we want, or already have, to enable cross-team coworking.

**Browser Automation:**

## Test Automation Implementation Roadmap

### Pilot Program (Phase 0: Month 0-2)

- **Objective:** Validate the upskilling approach, initial tool choices, and identify unforeseen challenges on a smaller scale.
- **Selection:** Choose a small group of enthusiastic testers and a suitable, relatively stable project.
- **Activities:**
  - Intensive foundational programming and automation tool training for the pilot team.
  - Automate a few high-value manual test cases for the selected project (UI or API).
  - Establish basic framework structure and CI integration for the pilot.
- **Outcome:** Lessons learned, refined training plan, initial success stories, and a tested approach for broader rollout.

### Phase 1: Foundational Automation Skills & Initial Wins (Months 3-5, post-pilot)

**Focus:** Empowering manual testers with core automation skills and delivering early value

**Key Areas:**

- **Foundational Programming:** Python or JavaScript (chosen based on assessment and target application stack).
- **Test Automation Fundamentals:** Principles of good test design, selectors, basic framework usage (e.g., Playwright for UI, Postman/Newman or Python `requests` for API).
- **Automating Existing Manual Tests:** Convert high-value, repetitive manual test cases into automated scripts.
- **UI Automation Patterns:** Introduce concepts like Page Object Model (POM) early.
- **Version Control:** Git fundamentals for test script management.
- **Unit Testing (Developer Focus / Advanced Testers):**
  - Establish comprehensive unit test coverage standards (minimum 80%)
  - Implement test-driven development (TDD) practices
  - Integrate mutation testing to validate test quality
  - Set up automated test execution in CI/CD pipelines

**Success Metrics**: Test coverage percentage, test execution time, defect detection rate

#### What to Automate First: Prioritization Strategy

- **High-Value, Repetitive Tests:** Manual tests that are run frequently and are time-consuming.

- **Performance Impact**: Continuous monitoring and optimization of test execution resources

### Organizational Risks

- **Skill Gap Management**: Phased learning approach with mentorship support

- **Resource Allocation**: Clear ROI demonstration and incremental value delivery

- **Cultural Resistance**: Change champions program and success story sharing
- **Overwhelming the Team:** The phased rollout, starting with a pilot and focusing on foundational skills first, is designed to mitigate this. Timelines will be flexible based on team progress.
- **Maintaining Automation Suites:** Emphasize good coding practices, design patterns (POM), and code reviews for test scripts from the outset. Allocate time for refactoring.

## Implementation Timeline

**Quarter 1**: Detailed assessment completion, Pilot Program execution and review, foundational programming & automation training for initial cohort.

**Quarter 2**: Broader rollout of Phase 1 (Foundational Automation), establish CoP, begin automating initial UI/API tests based on prioritization.

**Year 2 Onwards**: Full implementation of Phase 3 & 4, continuous improvement, and adaptation.

## Estimated Earned Value

**Expected ROI**: 150-200% within 24 months through reduced manual testing
costs, faster release cycles, and improved software quality.
